Welle was the German designation for groups of infantry divisions raised at approximately the same time, with approximately the same type of organization and equipment, and that shared a similar type of personnel and level of training.\nFrom 1939 to 1945 there were at least 35 “Wellen” formed in the various 'Wehrkreise' (Military Districts), under the supervision of the 'Ersatzheer' (Replacement Army).\n\n§RDeveloper note!!§!\nMost units of Welle 1 are being deployed with the start-up of the game.

 GER_1_L_div_desc:0 "The 1. Leichte Brigade was a mechanized unit established in October 1937 in imitation of the French Division Légère Mécanique. It was intended to take on the roles of army-level reconnaissance and security that had traditionally been the responsibility of cavalry. It included mechanized recon units, motorized infantry, and a battalion of tanks. The concept of the Leichte Brigade, of which three were planned by the Wehrmacht, quickly showed its flawed nature and was abandoned.\nIn November 1938 the brigade was enlarged to become the §Y1. Leichte Division§!, receiving the §Y11. Panzer-regiment§! as an attachment for its participation in the occupation of the Sudetenland in October 1938 and the subsequent disestablishment of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. Following the latter the division received 130 Czech-built tanks which were superior to the Panzer I and Panzer II the division had been equipped with. In 1939, the division fought in the Invasion of Poland."

The division was designed to provide mobility and some armoured protection to its forces, and was composed of the 6. and 7. Kavallerie-Schützen Regiments, the 7. Aufklärungs-Regiment and the 66. Panzer-Battalion. These were supported by the 78. Artillery Regiment, the 58. Pionier Battalion and the 42. Panzerabwehr Battalion. Its single Panzer battalion was equipped with the Panzer I training tank and the Panzer II interim production tank. Both these vehicles were small, lightly armed and lightly armoured.

 GER_TV_Schutzstaffel:0 "SS-Totenkopfverbände"
 GER_TV_Schutzstaffel_desc:0 "The SS was closely associated with Nazi Germany's concentration camp system. On 26 June 1933, Himmler appointed SS-Oberführer Theodor Eicke as commandant of Dachau concentration camp, one of the first Nazi concentration camps. It was created to consolidate the many small camps that had been set up by various police agencies and the NSDAP to house political prisoners. The organizational structure Eicke instituted at Dachau stood as the model for all later concentration camps. After 1934, Eicke was named commander of the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), the SS formation responsible for running the concentration camps under the authority of the SS and Himmler. Known as the \"Death's Head Units\", the SS-TV was first organized as several battalions, each based at one of Germany's major concentration camps. Leadership at the camps was divided into five departments: commander and adjutant, political affairs division, protective custody, administration, and medical personnel. By 1935, Himmler secured Hitler's approval and the finances necessary to establish and operate additional camps. Six concentration camps housing 21,400 inmates (mostly political prisoners) existed at the start of the war in September 1939. By the end of the war, hundreds of camps of varying size and function had been created, holding nearly 715,000 people, most of whom were targeted by the regime because of their race. The concentration camp population rose in tandem with the defeats suffered by the Nazi regime; the worse the catastrophe seemed, the greater the fear of subversion, prompting the SS to intensify their repression and terror."

This was however made an independent unit July 1939 and moved to Danzig were it was used to form SS-Heimwehr-Danzig. Ostmark was transferred to Prague in October 1939 were it relieved SS-Standarte Der Führer which was made a part of SS-Verfügungs Division.

Members of other SS militias were also transferred into the division in early 1940; these units had been involved in multiple massacres of Polish civilians, political leaders and prisoners of war. The division had officers from the SS-Verfugungstruppe (SS-VT), of whom many had already seen action in Poland. The division was commanded by SS-Obergruppenführer Theodor Eicke.
