	##### Royal New Zealand Army 1935/1936 #####
	# Based on yearly NZDF reports to NZ Government
	# 1935/1936 RNZA totalled 566 regular personnel (including 173 in the permanent staff), and 9041 active territorial personnel.
	# Chief of Army 1937 reported that only 1/3 of territorial personnel could be considered trained
	# In addition there were a maximum of 20648 members of the Cadets or Rifle Clubs. Police force in addition to this. All militia, not fully equipped, not available for overseas service. Could be activated by event in case of invasion.
	# The field force in Jan 1936 was organised as a complete infantry division (with 3 brigades of 3 battalions), plus 3 mounted rifle brigades. Later re-organised 1937.
	# These were very much under establishment, with battalions (4 company) having the strength of companies (approx 100) and sometimes less. Mounted rifle regiments (3 squadron) were at squadron strength (approx 160)
	# The organisation was left at division level to aid rapid expansion in case of mobilisation.
	# The administrative formations were three military districts, as featured in vanilla
	# Training and equipment were poor. The forces in being were far from being an infantry force capable of being sent overseas
	# There was a complete issue of boots and uniforms that were considered satisfactory, for the actual strength.
	# There was not enough equipment or stores for the establishment strength.
	# There were probably enough rifles for the actual strength. Maintenance was not satisfactory
	# There was enough ammunition for peacetime practice, but some of it was old or unreliable
	# Historically had stocks of WW1-era artillery, upto 85 18pdr/4.5 in how, upto 27 6 in how
	# No trucks routinely deployed with the field forces Jan 1936. Commercial trucks were hired as required. Trials of truck-drawn artillery commenced early 1937.
	# Plan was to requisition commercial vehicles in case of mobilisation. Very limited funds for equipment purchase Jan 1936.
